                    <h3>Provo City Center Temple</h3>
                    <p>This beautiful temple sits right in the middle of downtown Provo, Utah. It has a rich history
                        that has inspired many people.
                        The site originally had a meetinghouse, constructed in the 1850's, for the saints in the valley.
                        In 1882 ground was broken to begin construction on the Utah Stake Tabernacle. It was built right
                        next to the meetinghouse. The meetinghouse was torn down in 1918 and was made part of the
                        tabernacle lawn. <br><br>
                        On Dec 17, 2010 the tabernacle caught fire. The entire inside of the the building was destroyed.
                        Only the outer brick walls remained. It was a tragedy felt felt far and wide, yet during the
                        October 2011 general conference latter-day saints were able understand how God can transform a
                        tragedy into a miraculous blessing. He announce it would become a temple. The temple was
                        dedicated in 2016.

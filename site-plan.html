        <h4>Scenarios</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>My husband and I just received our senior mission papers to be a temple worker. Where are we going to
                stay?</li>

            <li>I’m so excited about Jane’s engagement and her decision to married in the temple. I need to find
                accommodations for the out of town guests.</li>

            <li>This temple youth trip is going to be such a great experience for these kids. Where can all of us stay
                that will help them feel the spirit they feel in the temple to make this an extra special experience for
                them?</li>

            <li>I really want to go to my sister’s sealing! How am I going to find a babysitter for my kids?</li>

            <li>I’m so excited for my mission. I need to find a place to stay close to the temple when I take out my
                endowments. I know I won’t be able to get to the temple and back in one day, since it is such a long
                drive. I wonder where I can find a place to stay the night before.</li>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Raleway</h4>

            shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe
            alternative for your family.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored fontexample">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from
            traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and
            freshing up in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>

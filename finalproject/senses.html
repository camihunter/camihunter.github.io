            <h3>A New Challenge</h3>
            <p>When you write your story, I want you to try something new. I want you to close your eyes and imagine the
                scene you are writing. Focus on specific details. What do you see? What do you smell? What do you taste?
                What do you hear? What do you feel?</p><br><p>These questions will help you write in a way that will allow the
                reader to experience your writing in a more meaningful way. When your write, ask yourself, <strong>"Am I
                    telling
                    what's happening, or am I showing?"</strong></p>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p>Look at the picture of this family below. Think through each of the senses and write down descriptive words. Practice writing sentences using the words you wrote down.</p><br>
            <p>Check out examples below the picture to see the difference between 'telling' and 'showing'.</p>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <h4>Telling</h4>
            <p>I got water in my eyes.</p>
            <h4>Showing (Sight)</h4>
            <p class="bottommargin">I squeezed my eyes to blink away the water from my eyes, but the constant downpour made it seemed as if I was looking through a fogged up window.</p>
            <h4>Telling</h4>
            <p>We were laughing.</p>
            <h4>Showing (Sound)</h4>
            <p class="bottommargin">I could hear each of my siblings laughter over my own. Although, my little sister's
                squeal of
                delight almost completely overshadowed the rest.</p>
            <h4>Telling</h4>
            <p>We splashed each other.</p>
            <h4>Showing (Touch)</h4>
            <p class="bottommargin">All eight legs kicking wildly created a fountain raining down on my head.</p>
            <h4>Telling</h4>
            <p>I was by the ocean.</p>
            <h4>Showing (Smell)</h4>
            <p class="bottommargin">As I took a deep breath, the fresh, salty air energized me as it filled my lungs</p>
            <h4>Telling</h4>
            <p>I got water in my mouth.</p>
            <h4>Showing (Taste)</h4>
            <p class="bottommargin">As I laughed, a salty splash tingled my tongue.</p>
